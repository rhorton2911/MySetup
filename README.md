# MySetup
Contains my .vimrc and .bashrc files, customised to my liking. I created this repoistory so that additions to my vim and bash setups would be available for use on all my devices. 

I prefer to use bash rather than zsh. This is mainly an issue of compatibility. Much of my work is done using the 'Setonix' supercomputer maintained by the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre in Perth, Western Australia. The machine requires users to make use of an object storage system (using the amazon S3 protocol) called 'Acacia' to store their data. I prefer to access the Acacia server using the minIo (mc) client. The mc client allows unix like tab auto-completion of object names when run through bash, but not zsh. Given that object names can be quite long, this is necessity and thus I use bash as my default shell. I will attempt to migrate if and when this feature is made available to zsh users.
